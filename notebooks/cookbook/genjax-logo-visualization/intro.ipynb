In the context of distributions, an energy function can be thought of as a way to assign a \"cost\" or \"energy\" to each point in the space. The density of the distribution is then inversely proportional to the energy at each point. In this case, the energy function is binary, with 0 energy in the white regions and infinite energy in the black regions, effectively defining a distribution with density 1 in the black regions and 0 in the white regions.\n",
