    "In the previous cookbook, we have seen a brief preview of `edit` through via a specific request, `IndexRequest`. More generally, `edit` is a general method for updating a trace using an `EditRequest`, `IndexRequest` being one such kind of requests. These have to follow some inference logic. The highest level idea is that `edit` moves implement SMCP3 [Lew & Matheos et al.] moves, but it's easier to understand via some examples. "
